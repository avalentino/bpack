.. description

The *bpack* Python package provides tools to describe and encode/decode
binary data.

Binary data are assumed to be organized in *records*, each composed by a
sequence of fields. Fields are characterized by a known size, offset
(w.r.t. the beginning of the record) and datatype.

The package provides classes and functions that can be used to:

* describe binary data structures in a declarative way (structures can
  be specified up to the bit level)
* automatically generate encoders/decoders for a specified data descriptor

Encoders/decoders (*backends*) rely on well known Python packages like:

* |struct| (form the standard library)
* bitstruct_ (optional)
* numpy_ (optional)
* bitarray_ (optional) - partial implementation
